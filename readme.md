# Scheme Color Generator

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This is a simple web app that generates 5 different colors using the [Color API][colorapi] and allows you to copy the selected color to the clipboard. This is my first API project and it's designed to showcase my skills in fetching and manipulating data from an API.

## Features

- Generates 5 different colors using the Color API
- Allows you to copy the selected color to the clipboard
- Uses an input type color selector to randomly create a color
- Calls the Color API to fetch the different options that you can select within that color

## How to use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Use the color selector to randomly create a color.
5. Click on any of the generated colors to select it.
6. Select the color you want to copy to the clipboard.
